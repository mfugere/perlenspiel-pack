Perlenspiel Games
=================
These games were created using Lua and the Perlenspiel library created by Brian Moriarty. They intend to focus on concept and design, rather than art assets.

The following games are included in this pack, and all include executable files.

Samsara
-------
Complete quests to gain or lose karma, which determines your form upon reincarnation. Perform enough good deeds to attain Moksha.

Beat Field
----------
Fire notes at sensors while dodging note-silencing rhythm blocks to create unique songs. Each level offers a new musical theme!

Tether
------
You exist in two alternate dimensions. Move within the auras of one another to solve puzzles and patch up the holes between your dimensions (intended for two players on a single keyboard).

Indigo: The Pucening
--------------------
Survive the endless pucening and waves of Indigoons as long as possible.

Viralperlenspiel
----------------
Spread colors to create a path to the exit. Avoid arrows and the moving hole!

Perlensequencer
---------------
Clicking within the grid creates piano and drum loops, and alters the tempo.
